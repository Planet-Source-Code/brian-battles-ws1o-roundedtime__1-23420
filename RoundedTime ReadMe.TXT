THIS IS FREE CODE! NO COST, FEES OR RESTRICTIONS! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, BLAH BLAH BLAH...

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to generate a string containing the time rounded to the nearest N minutes (1 to 60 minutes, in this sample project).

This could be useful if, for example, you need an event to fire at 10-minute intervals, or if you want to set time stamps for something like collecting real-time data, etc.

I wrote it to search a scheduler-type database for users who had specified that they needed to receive reminders, where we only wanted to execute the actual reminder operation every 10 minutes, so we would grab records that fell within a 10-minute range and run them all as a sort of batch operation.

I imagine you may well be able to think of your own uses for this. Feel free to modify, improve or otherwise fold, spindle and mutilate this little project to your heart's content!

Don't feel obligated to vote for me or give me any credit or anything...it's just my turn to contribute something back.
